- `analyzer/comprehensive_analysis_engine.py`: Still has 0.95, 0.85, 0.80
- `analyzer/policy_engine.py`: Still has 25, 0.95 (multiple instances)
- `analyzer/constants.py`: Still has 0.95 (security threshold)

#### Integration Status:
- **Files with constant imports:** 5 (0.76% of Python files)
- **Expected replacements:** ~287 HIGH priority violations
- **Actual integration:** ~12% based on import analysis
