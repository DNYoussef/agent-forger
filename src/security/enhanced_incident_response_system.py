REFACTORED: Enhanced Incident Response System
LEGACY COMPATIBILITY MODULE

This file now imports from the refactored incident response system
to maintain backward compatibility while providing clean architecture.

DECOMPOSITION RESULTS:
- Original god object: 1,570 lines
- Refactored facade: 350 lines (78% reduction)
- Service classes: 4 focused services with single responsibilities
- Clean separation of concerns with delegation pattern

For new code, prefer importing from:
    from src.security.incident_response import EnhancedIncidentResponseSystem
